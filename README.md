# R + ggplot2 + R Markdown

R is a language primarily focused on statistical computing.
ggplot2 is a popular library for charting in R.
R Markdown is a document format that compiles to HTML or PDF and allows you to include the output of R code directly in the document.

To visualized the cars dataset, I made use of ggplot2's `geom_point()` layer, with aesthetics functions for the color and size.

While it takes time to find the correct documentation, these functions made the effort creating this chart minimal.

For one of my tools I used Excel. It was pretty easy to create the plot after the initial learning curve of 
understanding how to use the tool. I first had to relearn how to put multiple different plots on the same graph which 
took some playing around with tools. I then had to figure out that I needed to make it with a bubble plot instead of a 
scatter plot in order to make the points different sizes based on bill length. I also had to play around with the scale
of the bubbles because if you scaled using the area of the bubbles, all the bubbles would look the same, so you had 
to make sure you were scaling by the width of the bubbles. Additionally, I had to guesstimate the colors for the bubbles
because it would not let me enter a hex value to make them the exact color as the example graph. I can see this tool 
being very useful because it is both easy to use and fairly easy to learn. Once you learn how to use the features, 
making a graph is easy. It is also useful because it does not require knowing how to code, so it can be used by the 
general public. 

Technical Achievement: 
My technical achievement for my Excel graph was adding a legend, background color, and changing the color of the 
margins. I was able to more closely replicate the original graph by figuring out how to add a legend to the side, change
the background to light gray, and change the margin lines to be white. 

Design Achievement: 
My design achievement for my Excel graph was using a consistent styling for the words within the graph. I made sure to 
keep my graph consistent by using Times New Roman for all the features within the graph. I also made sure the axis 
titles and legend titles were bold so that they drew more attention, while keeping the axis labels regular so they did
not have as much emphasis.
